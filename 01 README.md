# shopee_scraper
Hi, this is a simple scraper I have created to scrap link of the products from shopee.
As shopee is considered as a dynamic website, hence I am using Selenium to perform the scraping.
Initial thought of creating and sharing this repo was because I can hardly find tutorials or repo regarding scraping dynamic webiste using selenium.
Hence, hope that this repo could inspire you and serves as reading materials if you are learning on scraping dynamic e-commerce website.
Follow me if you are interested to know more on creating scraper using selenium and share your thought with me in the comment.

Stay healhty and cheers!!!!
